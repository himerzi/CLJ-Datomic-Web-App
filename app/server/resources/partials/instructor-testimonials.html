			<p>
				Teaching A Crash Course in Clojure with Dactic was a huge pleasure & immensely rewarding. I got to meet enthusiastic developers and help them on their journey into Functional Programming; give something back to the Clojure community; and solidify all the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained myself over the years. It was a brilliant opportunity & a highlight of my year.

			<p>
				I had very little prior training experience, and getting the experience of teaching a Dactic course proved to be very valuable. We didn't have to worry about any of the administration of the courses in terms of marketing/students/payments/etc - thankfully! The money wasn't really a consideration, but was enough to make sure that the students were bought in - course attendance was good even until the last week.

			<p>
				The Student's were amazing, and it was inmensly gratifying to see their 'lightbulb moments', and to know that you've set them along a good path of learning Clojure.
