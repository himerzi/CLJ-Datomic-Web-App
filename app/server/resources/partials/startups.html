			What does "hosting" a course mean?

			Hosting a course means you have Wifi and can seat eleven people, for one evening a week for four weeks (the typical length of a course). Hosts are listed as sponsors for the course, and you're free to mingle & advertise yourselves to the developers in attendance.
