CLJ-Datomic-Web-App
===================

A web-app that uses Clojure & Datomic. Hopefully, this can serve as a helpful example to anyone looking to build a website back-end using Clojure & Datomic. The back-end is nothing more than a REST JSON API with basic CRUD facilities (including sessions, authentication, authorisation). Uses Angular for front end JS.

It's all pretty messy, and needs a good refactoring. But it was a fun experience, certainly when put in contrast with using traditional MVC back-end frameworks (Rails, Django).

There is also an example of how one can incorporate the Datomic Peer library as a local private maven repository (to get around the fact the library isn't distributed publicly)
